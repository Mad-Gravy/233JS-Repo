// JavaScript file for V2 of the Tic Tac Toe game, comments by Brian Bird, winter term 2025.

// These comments provide less detail than those in previous apps you completed
//  with the idea that you will do more problem-solving on your own in this one.

// Declare a class named GameGrid. This class should only contain game-play logic, no UI code.
{
    /* Declare and initialize properties */

    /* Add a constructor 
      - initialize an array of 9 elements with null values
      - initialize a 2-D aray to hold cordiantes of the 9 winning line combinations. */

    /* Add methods needed for the game logic. Suggestions:
        - makeMove with a parameter of index, this puts an X or O in the array
        - checkForWinner loops through the array looking for a winning line
        - checkForTie loops through the array looking for a tie game */
}

// Declare a class named GameUI. This class should mainly contain UI code, minimal game-play logic.
{
    /* Declare and initialize properties */

    /* Add a constructor 
       - Instantiate the GameGrid class.
       - Add event listeners to the 9 game squares. */

    /* Add methods needed for the UI. Suggestions:
        - highlightWinner turns the winning row red
        - disableAll disables the event handlers for all squares.
        - handleClick is a handler for cards on the HTML page, calls makeMove */
