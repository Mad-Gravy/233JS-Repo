  - After each roll, click on one die to move it into the scoring area.  
    You can't make a die move until you have rolled.
  - After moving all three die into the scoring area, click on "End Turn"
- Player 2's turn will start and palyer 2 will do the same things
- After player 2 ends their turn, they will click on "End Round"
  - The next round proceeds like the first one.
- Players decide how many rounds they want to play. the player who wins the most rounds wins the game.
